Here to assess the softskills based on eye for detailing ,I have made a criteria that if out of 30 marks user scores 30 ,user is great at his observatory skills.
If he scores 20 can be done better.If less than 20 he need to improve a lot.
if user successfully completes the puzzle ,user will be taken to the treasure box as it indicates win.
It contains clues and dead ends.when a user completely answers wrong answers it is dead end.
I have used javascript for this project.
